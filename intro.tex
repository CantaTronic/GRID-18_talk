        \item \textbf{Data Life Cyce (DLC)} is the sequence of stages that a particular unit of data goes through from its initial generation 
        or capture to its eventual archival and/or deletion. The typical data life cycle includes data gathering, processing, storage, analysis, sharing and archiving. 
        % The data life cycle provides a high level overview of the stages involved in successful management and preservation of data for use and reuse.
