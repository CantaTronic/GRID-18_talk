  \item UHE and VHE $\gamma$-ray point source search;
  \item Stacked analysis of KASCADE events for HAWC sources with $E > 56$~TeV;
%   \item \textit{2HWC\_2019+367} and \textit{2HWC\_J2013+415} are in the KASCADE field of view;
  \item \textit{2HWC\_2019+367} and \textit{2HWC\_J2013+415};
  \item Expected gamma flux is calculated for \textit{2HWC\_J2013+415} up to 1~PeV;
%   \item Our plan is:



%     \item UHE and VHE $\gamma$-s investigations open up a fruitful opportunities for enriching knowledge about intragalactic cosmic ray sources and propagation and for a new physics search;
%     \item We are developing stacked analysis methods (used, in particular, in recent works by Carpet-2) for investigation of KASCADE events, which could be associated with published HAWC sources with $E > 56$~TeV;
%     \item There are two HAWC sources in the KASCADE field of view: \textit{2HWC\_2019+367} and \textit{2HWC\_J2013+415};
%     \item For \textit{2HWC\_J2013+415} we calculated the expected gamma flux for energies of 56, 100~TeV and 1~PeV. The flux calculations for \textit{2HWC\_J2019+367} require accurate corrections on zenith angle and will be performed further;
%     \item Employing the expected fluxes and the background isotropy estimation, we are going to study the possible background exceed within a 5$^\circ$ radius around the sources;
%     \item Due to the energy scales compatibility of KASCADE/KASCADE-Grande and Tunka-133, the analysis below can be extended to data from the TAIGA experiment (Tunka valley, Russia).

\textcolor{kit-green100}{\textbf{Future plans}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Study the possible background exceed within a 5$^\circ$ radius around the sources;
    \item Extend to the data from the TAIGA experiment;
    \item Check other sources within our galaxy.
