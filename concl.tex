\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The KASCADE-Grande project has a data center called KCDC, that is planned to serve as the basis for the future common center for data access;
    \item The differences in the data formats were analyzed and solutions for organizing storage and distributed data processing were proposed;
    \item A scheme of a relational database for the future data center is designed using a metadata-based approach;
    \item The possibilities to apply the results of the project to educational and outreach activities are being explored.
    \item We are developing a new approach to the astroparticle data life cycle for combined analysis of the KASCADE-Grande and TAIGA data;
    \item The built-up infrastructure will be used to analyze combined data sets with large statistics, allowing to study galactic sources of high-energy $\gamma$-rays, which could be a notable step forward in multi-messenger astroparticle physics.
