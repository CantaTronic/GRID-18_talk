\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\gamma$-rays:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item are not deflected by interstellar magnetic fields $\Rightarrow$ can be tracked to their origin;
        \item can be used for point sources search;
%         \item are able to provide answers about the Galactic cosmic ray propagation;
        \item $\gamma$-ray flux study could bring us insights on cosmic rays acceleration mechanisms.
    \end{itemize}
    \item VHE and UHE $\gamma$-rays:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not so well-investigated because of flux intensity decrease for all CR particles at higher energies and because of a large absortion on the cosmic microwave background and interstellar matter;
        \item are supposed to be produced by black holes, neutron stars, supernova remnants, super-bubbles / star-forming regions / young massive star clusters;
        \item could improve our understanding about properties of matter in extreme states that cannot be studied in laboratories.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
