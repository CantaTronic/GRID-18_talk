\section{High-enegry $\gamma$ sources}

\begin{frame}{Why to study?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\gamma$:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item are not deflected by interstellar magnetic fields $=>$ can be tracked to their origin;
	\item can be used for point sources search;
	\item are able to provide answers about the Glactic cosmic ray propagation;
	\item $\gamma$-ray flux study could bring us insights on cosmic rays acceleration mechanisms.
    \end{itemize}
    \item high-energy $\gamma$ (above 100 Tev):
    \begin{itemize}
	\item not so well-inverstigated because of flux intensity decrease for all CR particles at higher enegries;
	\item are supposed to be produced by black holes, neutron stars, supernova remnants, superbubbles/star-forming
	regions/young massive star clusters;
	\item could improve our understadnding about properties of matter in extreme states that cannot be studied in laboratories.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item six sources in the Galactic plane that emit above 56 TeV. 
  \item two of them continue to emit past 100 TeV.
